# Azure SIEM Setup and Log Ingestion

## Project Overview
This project focuses on setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using Microsoft Azure Sentinel. The goal is to ingest, analyze, and visualize logs from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents. This project is essential for understanding cloud-based SIEM capabilities and their role in enhancing organizational security.

## Approach & Tools
### Environment Setup:
- Configured an Azure Sentinel workspace within the Azure portal.
- Integrated data sources such as Azure Activity Logs, Office 365, and Syslog from on-premises devices.

### Tools Used:
- **Azure Sentinel:** A scalable, cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution.
- **Log Analytics Workspace:** Used for storing and querying ingested log data.
- **Data Connectors:** Pre-built connectors for seamless integration with third-party tools and cloud services.
- **KQL (Kusto Query Language):** Used for advanced querying and analysis of log data.

## Procedure
1. Set up data connectors to ingest logs from selected sources.
2. Configure analytics rules to detect suspicious activities.
3. Design dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Why Azure Sentinel?
- **Cloud-Native Solution:** Eliminates the need for on-premises infrastructure, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.
- **Seamless Integration:** Natively integrates with Microsoft services and supports third-party tools.
- **Automation Capabilities:** Includes playbooks for automated incident response.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Helps meet regulatory standards through built-in compliance features.

## Implementation & Findings
### Steps Taken:
- Created an Azure Sentinel workspace and linked it to a Log Analytics Workspace.
- Configured data connectors for Azure Activity Logs, Office 365, and Syslog.
- Developed custom KQL queries for advanced log analysis.
- Designed and deployed dashboards to monitor system performance and security events.
- Configured analytics rules to detect anomalies such as brute force attempts, unusual login locations, and privilege escalations.

### Suggested Screenshots:
- **Log Ingestion:** Screenshot of the log ingestion process showing data sources and status.
- **KQL Queries:** Screenshot of the KQL query editor with an example query.
- **Dashboards:** Screenshot of a dashboard showing security metrics or trends.

### Key Observations:
- Successfully ingested logs from multiple sources, ensuring comprehensive visibility.
- Custom KQL queries allowed for precise filtering and analysis of logs.
- Alerts generated by analytics rules provided actionable insights into potential threats.

### Challenges Encountered:
- Initial difficulty in configuring certain third-party data connectors.
- Steep learning curve for mastering KQL for complex queries.
- High volume of log data required optimization to ensure efficient processing.

## Solutions & Recommendations
### Addressing the Issues:
#### Connector Configuration:
- Follow detailed documentation and troubleshoot common integration issues.
- Test each data source in isolation before full integration.

#### KQL Mastery:
- Utilize Microsoftâ€™s KQL training resources and community forums.
- Create a library of reusable query templates for common use cases.

#### Log Optimization:
- Implement log retention policies to manage storage costs.
- Use filters to focus on high-priority log data.

### Proposed Improvements:
- Expand log ingestion to include additional sources such as cloud app security and firewalls.
- Implement automation playbooks for incident response to reduce manual workload.
- Conduct periodic reviews of analytics rules to adapt to evolving threats.

### Next Steps:
- Integrate Azure Sentinel with a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform for enhanced incident management.
- Explore machine learning-based anomaly detection within Sentinel.
- Regularly update dashboards to include new metrics and trends.

### Suggested Screenshots:
- **Alerts and Incidents:** Screenshot of alerts or incidents generated by analytics rules.
- **Automated Playbooks:** Screenshot showing the configuration or execution of automation playbooks.

## Conclusion & References
This project demonstrated the capabilities of Azure Sentinel as a cloud-native SIEM solution for centralized log ingestion and analysis. By leveraging its advanced analytics and automation features, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture.
